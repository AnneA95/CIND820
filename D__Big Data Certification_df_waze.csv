Why do I need another display for my speed?  My car already has this function.  What I want from it is the speed limit display.  But you only get this in a very tiny bubble next to your current speed,.  Unless you are going exactly the right speed for your setting then it shows the speed limit fully. USELESS!  Whoever designed that had no clue what they were doing.  There should be an option to simply show the speed limit only at all times.  Maybe an optional speed display if you are exceeding the speed limit.  Next, the alerts.  These things are about as reliable as weather forecasting lol.  8 times out of 10 when there is something on the map like a cop or a car on the shoulder of the road it is not really there.

Hence the problem, Waze, like Google, is a data hog. Not a problem if you have unlimited data, but be careful if you don't and you use it a lot or go on a week-long trip and use it all the time. It also will not turn off when you turn it off. It stays on in the background. I use an app called Hibernate, which takes care of this and others, but have to remember to hit it every time. It also routinely crashes on my Android and will lose it's satellite connection if you were connected to WiFi and then drive away. Not sure what's up with that, but it will give you a bad connection and can't find your address. You can't just turn it off and start again. You have to go to your apps and force stop it, then restart it. Real PITA.

However, when I'm going a significant distance, navigation will suddenly stop after 100 miles or so.

Now, it's harder to use. Waze removed the always lock north up feature, so every time I open the app I have to manually reset it. The rest of this review applies to Waze overall, not just the last update. Route options are strange. Say I'm driving to point B. It will give me two different routes to point B that intersect at some point. So the two routes vary in the first half of the trip but should be the same once they intersect. It should be XXXZZZ and YYYZZZ. Instead, it gives me alternate second halves too. So it's XXXZZZ and YYYNNN. This makes it impossible to really compare routes by their ETA. So I end up doing two trips first one to intersection point. Second one from there. It takes a ton of clicks just to start a drive. 1) click in search bar. 2) type destination 3) pick from a terrible list 4) location opens, click go 5) route opens, click routes to see route 6) select route you like 7) click go again 8) click compass to lock north Just terrible. The search function is terrible too. It brings up weird results for businesses and is hard to read. It's hard to view businesses on a map. The ""are you a passenger?"" Is beyond frustrating. It's too easy to accidentally swipe open their carpool page that I don't use. There are way too many icons on the map. It's confusing. The bubbles are childish and block your view. I DON'T CARE IF SOMEONE REPORTED HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD. Why does it show me reports from the other side of the road? All it does is confuse things and make it hard to see what's actually on your route. It's not very good at re-routing. I have to manually re-routing multiple times during my commute. There's probably other things that I can't think of right now. Basically, use Google Maps for directions and this for alerts while driving (police, etc).",2,2,4.43.1.1,2018-09-26 12:10:03,,

However the most recent update has not only made it much worse, it seems to have become quite dangerous. We live in Qatar, which is a desert. When you drive out of Doha, the main city, you can go for a long time without seeing anything except sand and heat. My wife and her family used Waze to navigate to a kayaking place up in the North of Qatar, about 45km north of Doha. Waze took them almost to the southernmost point of Qatar before turning back up north, but also repeatedly directed them to nonexistent petrol stations. They finally ended up at a petrol station with little more than 5km left in the tank. By definition the people who use maps apps are the people who DON'T know enough about the route to sanity check the app. My wife shouldn't have to zoom out of the map to check that Waze isn't taking her in the completely opposite direction and tripling her travelling distance and possibly putting her life at risk by leaving her stranded in a desert. The fact that we now need to do so makes the app useless. Another case, i had to drive to an animal shelter last week, a 40km trip. Waze's initial route wanted me to drive 80 km. By making one change and driving straight instead of turning when Waze wanted me to, it immediately dropped to 40km with traffic showing as all clear. Why doesn't it pick that route in the first place?!!! It's extremely frustrating, a waste of our time, fuel and patience. The previous version was much much better. Is there any way to downgrade to an older version until you fix whatever issue you are having with your new algorithms?",1,0,4.44.0.5,2018-11-11 05:32:43,,

That's the major reason why I use it, although Google does provide the same features.  A few points , though.  1) I find that the estimated times are ALWAYS substantially less than actual.  On a normal one hour drive that sees added traffic, the estimate will be off by as much as 50%.  Surely with all the data available, including historical traffic and speed data, they can do better.  My old TomTom device would be the opposite, overestimating but at least close.  2) I detest the way that Waze selects routes.  Older devices allowed an option to ignore the local area.  Especially for repeated drives, everyone has their preferred local routes, and having Waze define the route as it chooses just makes it less useful. I'd like the app to allow me to ask for 'Most direct' route.  I don't want to zig zag all over the city, I want to go directly there  I know that I can edit the route to some extent, although that doesn't work on mobile very well, the system is awkward to use and faulty.  Perhaps the app could allow saving of specific ROUTES as well as locations, for those of us who merely want time and traffic information.",3,0,4.46.2.1,2019-01-09 17:33:12,,

It has some flaws but the pros outweigh the cons. One major con I've recently noticed is that I can no longer use the ""OK Waze"" voice command to enable Waze to listen to my commands whilst driving. I no longer report traffic incidents due to the removal of this function. I would have to touch the screen to turn on voice commands each time I want to give one now, which is illegal in Australia. The GPS speedometer function is great and having the ability to display the speed limit is also great. In heavy traffic, in unknown areas, sometimes speed limit signs are obscured from vision by vehicles or other objects, being able to confirm this by looking/listening to alerts alleviates some stress. The speed limits are not always up to date, particularly if the road is under construction. Re-routing directions based on delays/accidents in traffic is good, though, sometimes the full effects of a traffic incident is not known until it's too late and you're part of the slow traffic by that stage. The opposite can also be true - heavy traffic may be reported along your route but by the time you reach that section, it has already cleared up. If you make a mistake and need to make a U-turn, Waze doesn't specifically tell you to make a U-turn. The developers have done a great job - 5 stars if you bring back the voice commands.",4,0,,2020-04-11 00:37:55,,

The only way to get it back is to go to apps, force quit, and then restart. This is NOT something you want to do whilst driving.  Also the insistency of the app to drive you into traffic jams without  (or when it is too late) informing you about it is annoying. Especially when there are options to avoid them.   A positive way to say this is: It would be nice if Waze could inform a little earlier about upcoming trouble. The ""Five minute delays"" warning is not easy to navigate. There is not difference in trying to click the small X on the top right of the little window, or simply tap the message itself. It does NOT change the route to combat the delay, nor does it make you take the faster route if offered.   When you have your navigation set to Avoid High/motor ways, and you DO decide to go on motorways after all, you should have a simple on off option to (de)activate that route setting. Instead of having to go through the route setup completely.  When trying to get an overview of the REMAINING travel route, it ONLY shows you the complete route,  without indicating where you are NOW.

And one more think why do navigation has to always i mean 120% of the time has to start in the opposite direction. Just get the direction right once.

Other times, it will inexplicably try to re-run the last search,, and fail.   At any rate, a navigation app that can't handle loss of cell signal is pathetic. Google Maps doesn't have this problem, so why is it tolerated in Waze?  2. You can't simply navigate to a city. It will return a search result, but then will go back to the map view, with most of it shaded out except for a small spotlighted area. It never actually returns any routes, and you cannot enter navigation mode from this point. Searching for a specific address does not have this problem.   3. Speaking of search, for a product owned by Google, the search functionality is pathetic. Results are slow, inconsistent, and often not at all helpful.

Real time traffic speeds are pretty accurate, and it really trumps Google maps with some features, such as telling you what speed your going and the roads speed limit, which is pretty accurate, it also tells you about potential hazards such as stopped cars on a motorway, police etc which is surprising accurate. The eta for journeys is also accurate most of the time. But on to the negatives. Despite loving many things about this app, I feel it's sometimes tries to be too clever for its own good. I have experimented using navigation on the way back from work hoping to spend less time in traffic, so I let it choose a route and it said 45 mins, perfect. But what I didn't realise is that it took me on some really strange roads, single track in the middle of nowhere. Usually my commute is 19 miles and takes 55ish mins with rush hour traffic, the route it suggested was probably around 30 miles (after all the route changes) and took just over 50 eventually.

Unfortunately, there are two big annoyances, both of which have crept in slowly over time and become more and more annoying over time. 1) It talks too much! Way too much. It has always talked too much and now it's talking even more. They need a 4th setting under ""Voice and Sound"". Right now, we get Off, Alerts Only, and On. We need one between Alerts Only and On called ""Directions Only"". I don't want to know about railroad tracks. I don't want to know that my route is 23 minutes faster than some other route. I don't want to know that my route is similar to other routes. Just give me the fastest route, take me there, and talk as little as possible while keeping me from getting lost. 2) As they have continued to find new ways to monetize the app, the ads have become more and more annoying and intrusive. The pop-up every time you come to a stop is the biggest annoyance and let me say this: I have never - not once - been convinced to go into a business based on an ad in Waze. As a matter of fact, all my brain registers is ""annoyance"" and I touch the screen to click off of it. Waze needs to continue to monetize. I get that; but they need to figure out how to do it less intrusively and maybe more intuitively.

First and foremost, if you end a trip and forget to CLOSE the WAZE app it WILL EAT YOUR BATTERY. Seems logical that the developers should close the app when you reach your destination or at least have a pop up to ask whether you want to close the app. If you do not it will continue to run and delete your battery very quickly while using your internet connection even while your phone seems to be 'sleeping' (blank screen). Second, the update of the visual display of YOUR position relative to your next turn is not very predictive of where you need to turn. The voice prompts are also often nowhere near timely to avoid last minute lane changes or turns. Compared to Google Maps WAZE gets one star on this point while Google Maps gets 4 stars. If Google maps added the reporting functions of WAZE then WAZE would be obsolete. I don't care who gets it right first, but perhaps Google Maps is a better choice for most if you are not in a situation where traffic reports and ""police spotted ahead"" are important to you. WAZE is quite nice but other than the more real time reporting by other WAZE users of incidents and police activity I prefer Google Maps for better map view, not draining my battery if I forget to close it, and better advance warning of turns and which lane to be in for my next turn.",3,5,4.54.0.3,2019-08-29 03:20:19,,

The same happens with route reports, e.g., if there's a car stopped on shoulder, it displays the icon on the map, but doesn't display anything on the left (where 'Thumbs Up' and 'Not There' buttons are supposed to be).  However, based on my experience, this happens only after an ETA update message is displayed (e.g., 'Traffic is building up ahead...' etc.). This behaviour is pretty consistent, so it seems like there's something wrong with either layer re-drawing or visibility indicators for the layers responsible for route events.

Here are the main issues I have found which a beginner will find useful: 1. Creating a login was a frustrating process. Don't log in with your Google account because you allow Waze full access to lots of your Google details. 2. I found that the street I live on was named wrong, likely based on an error over 20 years old. So I created a login, then had to use the app to create and drive to, a destination from my home. That allowed me to edit the map error. It will take a day or two for the correction to show on the live map on the app, I am told. Why does Waze have errors that are decades old??? 3. I told the app I'm driving an Electric vehicle, but it still asks me what type gas I use, whether regular or premium! Crazy! Their suggestion box has suggestions about EVs since 2013, but Waze says ""we're working on it."" Even now in 2020, Waze maps do not show EV charge stations, despite choosing ""Electric Vehicle"" in settings. What the app desperately needs is to ask the user what the driver's EV's range is, and plot suitable locations to charge on the way. Waze MUST make sure that they only point to chargers that provide no less than 50 kWH charge rate. Tesla Superchargers provide 120+ kWh. Our Tesla is very smart, and tells us where to charge on the way. Not sure about non-Tesla EVs, whether they have that capability. So is there any advantage to using this over Google maps on my Android phone? NO. I thought about deleting the app after I verify that they did fix the map error, but eh, what the heck, I will just leave it on my phone! :) A positive thing: customer service was great with email support, and the Waze community is very responsive. I just hope I can come back in a year and give this app 5 stars!",3,58,4.68.2.0,2020-11-18 15:09:03,"Hi Raja, thank you for your feedback.

This app reminds you of your current speed and the potential risk of going over the Speed Limit. ✔️You can help others by reporting debris; report emergency road-side vehicles; potholes; weather conditions; crashes; slow to stand still traffic; even POLICE (wether obvious ones or elusive ""invisible"" one's hiding if someone can catch them beforehand); and much more. I've been heavily dependant on this app to help me navigate to where I need to go while being safe and ""complying with the law"" (lol). You can also manage what time you want to arrive to your destination and set reminders to let you remind you when to leave your current location at certain time(s). Once you set a navigation path it'll plan out your drive before you and notating when certain hazards or critical points of interest are reported to better plan out your drive. I'm saying this app is very useful and very reliable! The only downside is 'reported officers' warning notifications aren't really that reliable, as one that tends to speed sometimes. Reason being, as one who tends to look at the road while driving much more than their phone, ""Oh I know, a millennial that actually follows rules -rare"", I set notifications for cops on volume high to be warned in advance. But this app only warns you of 'reported officers' in too much of a short notice: usually within mere seconds of being in proximity of the officers location where you're more than likely spotted already going above the speed limit and caught by said officer...not useful. If this app can update that feature and warn drivers way in advance like a two-mile warning of 'reported officers' ""...that'll be greeaattt..."" Other than that, I have no complaints!

There is some automation that might be able to be pulled from devices such as speed and direction. So somethings that I would like to see and I have similar responses from others that also use Waze.

Just remember you dont need to follow Waze exactly. If the directions seem unsafe keep driving until you feel safe then follow Waze.",3,9,4.63.0.2,2020-06-12 20:29:11,,

I have been an abide Wazer for more than 5 years..... I never thought about adding a review of the app only because I felt that I never had the time. I would have given this app a 4 star review until today; hell, I used it over Google Maps! After the previous update though, things have changed. I used the app, as I do, for my long distance runs to see relatives and discovered that the GPS Triangulation has become ruined by the update. This means that where the app was capable of figuring out that you were within a specific radius of the current GPS tag and then taking your trajectory and momentum into account to determine your actual location and heading, to provide a fluid navigation experience; the current update has caused this software logic to crash and become nonfunctional. This leaves the app continually updating, eating data, and more importantly guessing your location and then altering your directions to redirect you to the route that you are already on. I was able to make it to my prime location the first time by ignoring the app inconsistencies and using the directions that I already knew. But then when I attempted to use the app to direct me to a short distance trip for coffee, it recommended so many wrong turns, and u-turns to correct for the wrong turns which it had just directed me, I became irate and was only able to successfully reach my destination through spoken directions given by my mother! If it wasn't for my mother I might still be lost in the journey to get coffee!!! So after my most harrowing of coffee runs and most irate of trips I was glad I didn't chuck my phone from the window going down the highway!!! This app is by definition unusable due to the poor quality of the previous software update. I am surprised Google allowed it to go live in this sort of disrepair. For that reason I am submitting a One Star review while sipping cold brew coffee and re-downloading google maps over Wi-Fi..... Because like I said, this app ate sooo much data having a stupid day that I am going to have to conserve the rest so I don't wind up paying for extra gigs from my provider!!! Thanks Waze....

It often comes just as the junction is coming and it's too late for me to change direction. Also it cannot differentiate junctions if the first and second ones are too close to each other.,3,0,4.65.0.2,2020-08-13 12:11:26,"Thanks for the feedback, Jaffa!
